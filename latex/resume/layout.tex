\newcommand{\bulletsIU}{%
  Pioneered the evolution of optimal sensorimotor configurations in simulated agents\, utilizing Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network (CTRNN) controllers\, achieving neural networks that were simultaneously smaller and more performant,%
  Modeled development of a C. elegans connectome\, leading to improved accuracy versus existing models and new perspectives on its structure,%
  Discovered a new biologically-realistic dynamic control system for cellular lineages\, with potential applications in synthetic biology and regenerative medicine,%
  Developed and launched an online application for the dynamical analysis of cellular differentiation in multi-compartment systems\, integrating multiple control mechanisms (see https://nanohub.org/resources/dynsysregen),%
  Conceived and implemented a novel level set approximation algorithm for high-dimensional manifolds\, significantly reducing computational complexity and resource usage by 90\%.%
